<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>In my full stack project, I used Express HTML for server-side rendering, which involved generating HTML on the server and sending
 it to the client. This approach is straightforward but static.
 I also utilized JavaScript to enhance HTML by adding interactivity and dynamic content
 updates, making the user experience more engaging. For a more modern approach, I implemented a
 Single-Page Application (SPA), which loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content using
 client-side JavaScript, offering a smoother and more responsive experience.</p>

<h2>Why NoSQL MongoDB?</h2>
<p>I chose MongoDB for the backend because it offers a flexible schema, allowing for easy adjustments to data structures as the project evolves. Its scalability supports handling large volumes of data efficiently, and its document-oriented storage aligns well with the data structures used in web applications, making it a good fit for managing complex data relationships.</p>

<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>JSON is a lightweight data format used for transmitting data between the server and client, whereas JavaScript is a programming language. JSON simplifies data exchange by being easy to parse and generate. During the project, I refactored code to improve its functionality and efficiency, and I created reusable UI components to ensure consistency and ease of maintenance across the application. This refactoring and reuse helped streamline development and enhance the overall quality of the code.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>In terms of API testing, I verified endpoints to ensure they correctly handled requests and responses, including testing for various security measures such as authentication and data protection. Understanding how different endpoints (e.g., GET, POST) function and implementing robust security practices were crucial for safeguarding the application against unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>This course has significantly advanced my professional development by providing hands-on experience with full stack development. I mastered skills in frontend technologies, backend management with MongoDB, API integration, and code optimization. These skills have made me more proficient in handling complex development tasks and enhanced my marketability as a candidate in the tech field.</p>
